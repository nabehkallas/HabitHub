# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

(1)-If you keep using getDoc, there isn't a dependency variable that will automatically detect changes inside Firestore. getDoc is a "one-and-done" request—it fetches the data once and stops.

To get the data to update whenever it changes in the database, you have two options:

Option 1: The "Real-Time" Way (Recommended)
Instead of getDoc, use onSnapshot. This sets up a "listener." You don't even need a dependency array for the data itself because Firestore stays connected and pushes updates to you.
(2)-if (Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'android') {
  auth = initializeAuth(app, {
    persistence: getReactNativePersistence(ReactNativeAsyncStorage)
  });
} else {
  auth = getAuth(app);
}
